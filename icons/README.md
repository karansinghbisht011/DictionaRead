# Icons

This directory should contain the following icon files:

- `icon16.png` - 16x16 pixels (toolbar icon)
- `icon48.png` - 48x48 pixels (extension management page)
- `icon128.png` - 128x128 pixels (Chrome Web Store)

## Creating Icons

You can create these icons using:

1. **Online tools**: Use any icon generator or image editor
2. **Design software**: Photoshop, GIMP, Figma, etc.

## Icon Design

The icons should represent:
- A book (for reading)
- A magnifying glass (for lookup)
- Clean, simple design that works at small sizes
- Blue color scheme (#3498db) to match the extension theme

## Temporary Solution

For development and testing, you can:
1. Use any 16x16, 48x48, and 128x128 PNG files
2. The extension will work without custom icons (Chrome will use default)
3. Replace with proper icons before publishing
