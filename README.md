# DictionaRead 📖

A Chrome extension for quick dictionary lookup without breaking your reading flow.

## Features

- **Quick Lookup**: Select any word or phrase and press `Cmd+Shift+L` (Mac) or `Ctrl+Shift+L` (Windows)
- **Smart Positioning**: Popup intelligently appears above or below your selection to avoid covering the text
- **Dynamic Contrast**: Automatically calculates optimal colors based on page background brightness
- **Fallback Support**: If no definition is found, provides a Google search link
- **Toggle Control**: Enable/disable the extension via the popup panel

## Installation

### Development Setup

1. **Clone or download** this repository to your local machine

2. **Open Chrome** and navigate to `chrome://extensions/`

3. **Enable Developer Mode** by toggling the switch in the top-right corner

4. **Click "Load unpacked"** and select the DictionaRead folder

5. **Pin the extension** to your toolbar for easy access

### Usage

1. **Select text** on any webpage
2. **Press the keyboard shortcut**:
   - Mac: `Cmd+Shift+L`
   - Windows/Linux: `Ctrl+Shift+L`
3. **View the definition** in the popup that appears near your selection (above or below, depending on available space)
4. **Dismiss the popup** by:
   - Clicking the × button
   - Pressing the ESC key
   - Clicking outside the popup

## Smart Positioning Feature

The extension now features intelligent popup positioning that ensures your selected text remains visible:

- **Automatic Detection**: Calculates available space above and below your selection
- **Smart Placement**: Chooses the best position (above or below) based on viewport space
- **No Text Coverage**: The popup never covers the text you're trying to look up
- **Viewport Awareness**: Adjusts position to stay within the browser window
- **Smooth Animations**: Different entrance animations for above/below positioning

### Positioning Logic:
1. **Above First**: Tries to position above the selection if there's enough space
2. **Below Fallback**: If not enough space above, positions below the selection
3. **Best Fit**: If neither position has enough space, chooses the side with more room
4. **Viewport Constraints**: Ensures the popup stays within the browser window
5. **Tight Spacing**: Uses minimal 5px margin for closer positioning to the selection

### Dynamic Contrast System:
1. **Brightness Detection**: Analyzes page background color brightness (0-255 scale)
2. **Smart Color Selection**: 
   - Very light backgrounds (>200 brightness) → Dark blue-gray popup with white text
   - Medium backgrounds (128-200 brightness) → Medium dark popup with light text  
   - Dark backgrounds (<128 brightness) → White popup with dark text
3. **Real-time Adaptation**: Colors are calculated and applied dynamically for each popup
4. **Accessibility**: Ensures high contrast ratios for optimal readability

## Technical Details

### Debugging

#### Quick Debugging Steps

1. **Reload the Extension**
   - Go to `chrome://extensions/`
   - Find DictionaRead and click the refresh/reload button

2. **Open Developer Tools**
   - **Background Script Console**: 
     - Go to `chrome://extensions/`
     - Find DictionaRead → Click "Inspect views: background page"
   - **Content Script Console**:
     - Go to any webpage → Press F12 → Go to "Console" tab

3. **Test the Keyboard Shortcut**
   - Select some text on a webpage
   - Press `Cmd+Shift+L` (Mac) or `Ctrl+Shift+L` (Windows)
   - Check both consoles for log messages

#### What to Look For

**In Background Console:**
- `Command received: lookup-word` - Confirms shortcut is working
- `Lookup command triggered!` - Confirms our handler is running
- `Extension enabled status: true` - Confirms extension is enabled
- `Active tab: [URL]` - Shows which tab is active
- `Selected text: [your text]` - Shows what text was selected

**In Content Console:**
- `DictionaRead content script loaded and ready` - Confirms script is loaded
- `Content script received message: [message]` - Confirms message received
- `Showing loading popup for: [text]` - Confirms popup should appear

#### Common Issues & Solutions

**No logs in Background Console:**
- **Problem**: Keyboard shortcut not registered
- **Solution**: Check if another extension is using the same shortcut

**"No text selected" log:**
- **Problem**: Text selection not working
- **Solution**: Make sure you actually select text before pressing shortcut

**"Extension enabled status: false":**
- **Problem**: Extension is disabled
- **Solution**: Click the extension icon and toggle it ON

**Content script not receiving messages:**
- **Problem**: Content script not loaded on the page
- **Solution**: Refresh the webpage and try again

#### Expected Flow

When working correctly, you should see this sequence:

1. **Background Console**: `Command received: lookup-word`
2. **Background Console**: `Lookup command triggered!`
3. **Background Console**: `Extension enabled status: true`
4. **Background Console**: `Active tab: [URL]`
5. **Background Console**: `Selected text: [your text]`
6. **Content Console**: `Content script received message: {action: "showLoading", ...}`
7. **Content Console**: `Showing loading popup for: [text]`
8. **Background Console**: Network request to dictionary API
9. **Content Console**: `Content script received message: {action: "showDefinition", ...}`
10. **Content Console**: `Showing definition popup for: [text]`
11. **Visual**: Popup appears on the webpage

If any step is missing, that's where the problem is!
